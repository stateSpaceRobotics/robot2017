These are models for the simulations.

urdf stands for [Unified Robot Description Format](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) and is an XML model format.

xacro, [XML macro](http://wiki.ros.org/xacro), is meant for more easily creating urdf models.

Most of the urdf files were created through the xacro files, using the command rosrun xacro xacro model.xacro > model.urdf.  I do not recall exactly, but I think the difference is that the spawner for gazebo can use either, but rviz can only use urdf.

Models:
* minir2d2.urdf
	* A version of r2d2 that is a tenth the original size
	* Has no gripper, it has been commented out
	* Starts with some commented out xacro properties, from the xacro file have the original variables commented out and replaced with ones a tenth their size
	* says it was made from r2d2.xacro, but I believe the file that was used to generate it was renamed minir2d2.xacro
* minir2d2.xacro
	* A version of r2d2 that is a tenth the original size
	* Has the code for the gripper commented out
* r2d2.urdf
	* generated from r2d2.xacro
	* include a Kinect facing forwards
	* includes a LIDAR facing backwards
	* includes the front gripper
* r2d2.xacro
	* include a Kinect facing forwards
	* includes a LIDAR facing backwards
	* includes the front gripper
* r2d2_noGazeboColors.urdf
	* Says it was generated by r2d2.xacro, but it is not from the most recent version
	* I have no idea why it is name noGazeboColor when it has the tags for gazebo colors
	* It has an attempt at a stereo camera on the front, not a kinect
	* No LIDAR
* r3d1.urdf
	* Generated from r3dx.xacro, but I believe it was copied from r3dx.urdf
	* Smaller version of r2d2.xacro, with the proportions redone for balance so it won't fall over in simulation or do other weird stuff
	* I beleive the only difference from r3d2/3/4/x.urdf is line 532, controlling the robotNamespace for the gazebo_ros_control plugin
	* Meant for minibots
* r3d2.urdf
	* Generated from r3dx.xacro, but I believe it was copied from r3dx.urdf
	* Smaller version of r2d2.xacro, with the proportions redone for balance so it won't fall over in simulation or do other weird stuff
	* I beleive the only difference from r3d1/3/4/x.urdf is line 532, controlling the robotNamespace for the gazebo_ros_control plugin
	* Meant for minibots
* r3d3.urdf
	* Generated from r3dx.xacro, but I believe it was copied from r3dx.urdf
	* Smaller version of r2d2.xacro, with the proportions redone for balance so it won't fall over in simulation or do other weird stuff
	* I beleive the only difference from r3d1/2/4/x.urdf is line 532, controlling the robotNamespace for the gazebo_ros_control plugin
	* Meant for minibots
* r3d4.urdf
	* Generated from r3dx.xacro, but I believe it was copied from r3dx.urdf
	* Smaller version of r2d2.xacro, with the proportions redone for balance so it won't fall over in simulation or do other weird stuff
	* I beleive the only difference from r3d1/2/3/x.urdf is line 532, controlling the robotNamespace for the gazebo_ros_control plugin
	* Meant for minibots
* r3dx.urdf
	* Generated from r3dx.xacro
	* Smaller version of r2d2.xacro, with the proportions redone for balance so it won't fall over in simulation or do other weird stuff
	* I beleive the only difference from r3d1/2/3/4.urdf is line 532, controlling the robotNamespace for the gazebo_ros_control plugin
	* Meant for minibots
* r3dx.xacro
	* Smaller version of r2d2.xacro, with the proportions redone for balance so it won't fall over in simulation or do other weird stuff
	* Meant to be able to easily create several different robot models from it, just by changing the xacro property robot_name value (line 19), which then changes should change the robotNamespace in the gazebo_ros_control plugin, but for some reason, that was not done, so it might be through something else
* r3dx_2.xacro
	* Like r3dx.xacro, but all the wheel names include the robot name and the robotNameSpace for the gazebo_ros_control plugin includes the robot name as well
	* Not used to make r3d1/2/3/4/x.urdf, since those don't have different wheel names
* r4d1.urdf
	* Small version of r2d2
	* Says the robot name is minir2d2, which fits with the sizes, but some of the scales are wrong
	* Does not include the gripper
	* Says it was generated from r4dx.xacro
* r4dx.urdf
	* Similar to r4d1.urdf, but some of the inertia and such as different
	* Includes gripper
	* robot name is r4d1, just like r4dx.xacro
	* Generated from r4dx.xacro
* r4dx.xacro
	* Most likely modified from minir2d2.xacro
	* Some sizes taken out of scale, most likely to help with simulator physics
	* te inertias are a tenth of the minir2d2's
